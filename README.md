# Ultrasonic-Radar-System
Radar is an object detection system that uses microwaves to determine the range, altitude, direction, and speed of objects within about a 100-mile radius of their location. We are going to design an Arduino radar project using Ultrasonic sensor for detection.
We are going to design an Arduino radar project using Ultrasonic sensor for detection. The components required are:
Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04, servo motor, breadboard and a few jumper wires.

Objective:
The main objectives of the project are: 
1. The aim of this Arduino Radar project is to achieve a radar system prototype based on an Arduino board that detects stationary and moving objects in the radar range.
2. The system also senses an obstacle in front of the sensor through the signal from it which is displayed on the laptop screen.
The radar systems are used for tracking other vehicles in the vicinity so as to avoid risk of collision.
